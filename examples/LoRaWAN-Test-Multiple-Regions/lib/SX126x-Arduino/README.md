## General info
I stumbled over the [SX126x LoRa family](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-transceivers) in a customer project. Most of the existing Arduino libraries for Semtech's SX127x family are unfortunately not working with this new generation LoRa chip. I found a usefull base library from Insight SIP which is based on the original Semtech SX126x library and changed it to work with the ESP32.   
For now the library is tested with an [eByte E22-900M22S](http://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.aspx?id=437) module connected to an ESP32 and an [Insight SIP ISP4520](https://www.insightsip.com/products/combo-smart-modules/isp4520) which combines a Nordic nRF52832 and a Semtech SX1262 in one module. It is as well tested with an [RAKwireless WisCore RAK4630](https://store.rakwireless.com/products) module    

__**Check out the example provided with this library to learn the basic functions.**__

Especially for the deep sleep support on the ESP32 check out the example DeepSleep.

## Functions
WORK IN PROGRESS    
**_Check out the example provided with this library to learn the basic functions._**    
See [examples](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/SX126x-Android/tree/master/examples)   

----
### Module specific setup    
To adapt the library to different modules and region specific ISM frequencies some defines are used. The following list is not complete yet and will be extended    

----
### Chip selection   
```cpp
#define SX1261_CHIP // if your module has a SX1261 chip    
#define SX1262_CHIP // if your module has a SX1262 or SX1268 chip    
```
----
### MCU to SX126x SPI definition
The hardware configuration is given to the library by a structure with the following elements
```cpp
  hwConfig.CHIP_TYPE = SX1262_CHIP;         // SX1261_CHIP for Semtech SX1261 SX1262_CHIP for Semtech SX1262/1268
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_RESET = PIN_LORA_RESET; // GPIO pin connected to NRESET of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_NSS = PIN_LORA_NSS;     // GPIO pin connected to NSS of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_SCLK = PIN_LORA_SCLK;   // GPIO pin connected to SCK of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_MISO = PIN_LORA_MISO;   // GPIO pin connected to MISO of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_DIO_1 = PIN_LORA_DIO_1; // GPIO pin connected to DIO 1 of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_BUSY = PIN_LORA_BUSY;   // GPIO pin connected to BUSY of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_MOSI = PIN_LORA_MOSI;   // GPIO pin connected to MOSI of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.RADIO_TXEN = RADIO_TXEN;         // GPIO pin used to enable the RX antenna of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.RADIO_RXEN = RADIO_RXEN;         // GPIO pin used to enable the TX antenna of the SX126x    
  hwConfig.USE_DIO2_ANT_SWITCH = false;     // True if DIO2 is used to switch the antenna from RX to TX
  hwConfig.USE_DIO3_TCXO = true;            // True if DIO3 is used to control the voltage of the TXCO oscillator
  hwConfig.USE_DIO3_ANT_SWITCH = false;     // True if DIO3 is used to enable/disable the antenna
  hwConfig.USE_LDO = false;                 // False if SX126x DCDC converter is used, true if SX126x LDO is used
  hwConfig.USE_RXEN_ANT_PWR = false;        // If set to true RADIO_RXEN pin is used to control power of antenna switch
```    
----
### Explanation for LDO and DCDC selection

The hardware of the SX126x chips can be designed to use either an internal _**LDO**_ or an internal _**DCDC converter**_. The DCDC converter provides better current savings and will be used in most modules. If there are problems to get the SX126x to work, check which HW configuration is used and set **`USE_LDO`** accordingly.   
If **`USE_LDO`** is not set in the hwConfig, DCDC is used as default.    

----
### Explanation for TXCO and antenna control

- RADIO_TXEN and RADIO_RXEN are used on [eByte E22-900M22S](http://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.aspx?id=437) module to switch the antenna between RX and TX    
- DIO2 as antenna switch is used in the example Semtech design as default and might be used by many modules   
- DIO3 as antenna switch is used by e.g. [Insight SIP ISP4520](https://www.insightsip.com/products/combo-smart-modules/isp4520) module which integrates a nRF52832 and a SX126x chip   
- Some modules use DIO3 to control the power supply of the TXCO.    
- Some modules use DIO2 to switch the antenna between RX and TX and a separate GPIO to power the antenna switch on or off. Switching the antenna switch off can reduce the power consumption. The GPIO used to control the antenna power is defined as RADIO_RXEN. LOW == power off, HIGH == power on.
----
## Usage
See [examples](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/SX126x-Android/examples).    
There is one example for [ArduinoIDE](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/SX126x-Android/tree/master/examples/PingPong) and one example for [PlatformIO](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/SX126x-Android/tree/master/examples/PingPongPio) available.    
The PingPong examples show how to define the HW connection between the MCU and the SX126x chip/module.     
Another example is for LoRaWan and is tested with a Single Channel ([ESP32](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/SX1262-SC-GW)) and a 8 Channel ([Dragino LPS8](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-gateway/item/148-lps8.html)) LoRaWan gateways. The examples can be found here: [ArduinoIDE](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/SX126x-Android/tree/master/examples/LoRaWan) and one example for [PlatformIO](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/SX126x-Android/tree/master/examples/LoRaWanPio)    

----
### Basic LoRa communication
----

#### HW structure definition
Structure to define the connection between the MCU and the SX126x 
```cpp
hw_config hwConfig;
```

----
#### GPIO definitions
GPIO definitions for an ESP32. Change it to the connections between the ESP32 and the SX126x in your specific HW design    
```cpp
// ESP32 - SX126x pin configuration

int RADIO_TXEN = 26;     // LORA ANTENNA TX ENABLE
int RADIO_RXEN = 27;     // LORA ANTENNA RX ENABLE
```

----

#define RF_FREQUENCY 868000000  // Hz
#define TX_OUTPUT_POWER 22      // dBm

#define LORA_IQ_INVERSION_ON false
#define RX_TIMEOUT_VALUE 3000
#define TX_TIMEOUT_VALUE 3000

#define BUFFER_SIZE 64 // Define the payload size here
```

----
#### Example HW configuration
Fill the structure with the HW configuration
```cpp
  // Define the HW configuration between MCU and SX126x
  hwConfig.CHIP_TYPE = SX1262_CHIP;         // Example uses an eByte E22 module with an SX1262
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_RESET = PIN_LORA_RESET; // LORA RESET
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_NSS = PIN_LORA_NSS;     // LORA SPI CS
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_SCLK = PIN_LORA_SCLK;   // LORA SPI CLK
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_MISO = PIN_LORA_MISO;   // LORA SPI MISO
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_DIO_1 = PIN_LORA_DIO_1; // LORA DIO_1
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_BUSY = PIN_LORA_BUSY;   // LORA SPI BUSY
  hwConfig.PIN_LORA_MOSI = PIN_LORA_MOSI;   // LORA SPI MOSI
  hwConfig.RADIO_TXEN = RADIO_TXEN;         // LORA ANTENNA TX ENABLE
  hwConfig.RADIO_RXEN = RADIO_RXEN;         // LORA ANTENNA RX ENABLE
  hwConfig.USE_DIO2_ANT_SWITCH = false;     // Example uses an eByte E22 module which uses RXEN and TXEN pins as antenna control
  hwConfig.USE_DIO3_TCXO = true;            // Example uses an eByte E22 module which uses DIO3 to control oscillator voltage
  hwConfig.USE_DIO3_ANT_SWITCH = false;     // Only Insight ISP4520 module uses DIO3 as antenna control
  hwConfig.USE_LDO = false;                 // Set to true if SX126x uses LDO instead of DCDC converter
  hwConfig.USE_RXEN_ANT_PWR = false;        // Antenna power is not controlled by a GPIO
```
----
#### Module specific initialization
----
- If you use a microcontroller and a separate board with the SX126x transceiver you need to define the hwConfig structure to define the GPIO's used to connect the two chips.
- If you use the Insight SIP4520 or the RAKwireless RAK4630/4631 modules the connections between the chips are fixed. In this case you do not need the hwConfig structure and can instead use simplified initialzation functions as shown below.
----
#### Module specific header files
----
- If you use a microcontroller and a separate board with the SX126x transceiver use the generic header files **`SX126x-Arduino.h`** and **`LoRaWan-Arduino.h`**
- If you use the RAKwireless RAK4630/4631 modules use the module specific header files **`SX126x-RAK4630.h`** and **`LoRaWan-RAK4630.h`**
- If you use the Insight SIP4520 modules use the module specific header files **`SX126x-ISP4520.h`** and **`LoRaWan-ISP4520.h`**
----
#### Initialize the LoRa HW
```cpp
  lora_hardware_init(hwConfig);
```
----
#### Simplified LoRa HW initialization for ISP4520 module
The ISP4520 module has the nRF52832 and SX1261 or 1262 chips integrated in a module. Therefore the hardware configuration is fixed. To initialize the LoRa chip you need only to specify if the module is based on a SX1261 (ISP4520 EU version) or on a SX1262 (ISP4520 US version).
```cpp
  lora_isp4520_init(SX1262);
```
----
#### Simplified LoRa HW initialization for RAK4630/4631 module
The RAK4630/4631 module has the nRF52840 and 1262 chips integrated in a module. Therefore the hardware configuration is fixed.    
```cpp
  lora_rak4630_init();
```
----
#### Initialize the LoRa HW after CPU woke up from deep sleep
When you want to use the deep sleep function of the ESP32 with external wake up source, you do not want to reset and reconfigure the SX126x chip after its IRQ woke up the ESP32. This re-init function sets up only the required definitions for the communication without resetting the SX126x
```cpp
  lora_hardware_re_init(hwConfig);
```

----
#### Setup the callbacks for LoRa events
```cpp
  RadioEvents.TxDone = OnTxDone;
  RadioEvents.RxDone = OnRxDone;
  RadioEvents.TxTimeout = OnTxTimeout;
  RadioEvents.RxTimeout = OnRxTimeout;
  RadioEvents.RxError = OnRxError;
  RadioEvents.CadDone = OnCadDone;
```

----
#### Initialize the radio
Initialize the radio and set the TX and RX parameters
```cpp
  Radio.Init(&RadioEvents);

  Radio.SetChannel(RF_FREQUENCY);

  Radio.SetTxConfig(MODEM_LORA, TX_OUTPUT_POWER, 0, LORA_BANDWIDTH,
                    LORA_SPREADING_FACTOR, LORA_CODINGRATE,
                    LORA_PREAMBLE_LENGTH, LORA_FIX_LENGTH_PAYLOAD_ON,
                    true, 0, 0, LORA_IQ_INVERSION_ON, TX_TIMEOUT_VALUE);

  Radio.SetRxConfig(MODEM_LORA, LORA_BANDWIDTH, LORA_SPREADING_FACTOR,
                    LORA_CODINGRATE, 0, LORA_PREAMBLE_LENGTH,
                    LORA_SYMBOL_TIMEOUT, LORA_FIX_LENGTH_PAYLOAD_ON,
                    0, true, 0, 0, LORA_IQ_INVERSION_ON, true);
```

----
#### Initialize the radio after CPU woke up from deep sleep
When you want to use the deep sleep function of the ESP32 with external wake up source, you do not want to reset and reconfigure the SX126x chip after its IRQ woke up the ESP32. Radio.ReInit() sets up only the required communication without resetting the SX1262. 
Radio.IrqProcessAfterDeepSleep() is checking the reason for the wake-up IRQ and calls the event handler
```cpp
  Radio.ReInit(&RadioEvents);

  Radio.IrqProcessAfterDeepSleep();
```

----
#### Start listening for packages
```cpp
  Radio.Rx(RX_TIMEOUT_VALUE);
```

----
### LoRaWan
**YOU NEED BELOW STEPS ONLY IF YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT THE LORAWAN FUNCTIONALITY, IT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR BASIC LORA COMMUNICATION**   
If you want to use [LoRaWan](https://lora-alliance.org/) communication some additional steps are required.    
You need to define a region. The defined region tells the library which frequency and which channels should be used. Valid regions are:    
- REGION_AS923 -> Asia 923 MHz
- REGION_AU915 -> Australia 915 MHz
- REGION_CN470 -> China 470 MHz
- REGION_CN779 -> China 779 MHz
- REGION_EU433 -> Europe 433 MHz
- REGION_EU868 -> Europe 868 MHz
- REGION_IN865 -> India 865 MHz
- REGION_KR920 -> Korea 920 MHz
- REGION_US915 -> US 915 MHz

More information:    
- **[Channel plan per Region](./CHANNELS.MD)**    
- **[Max packet size per Region and Datarate](./MAX_PACKET_SIZE.md)**
- **[LoRaWan Datarate to SF and BW table](./DATARATE.MD)**    

In addition you need
- Device EUI if you want to use ABP registration of the device
- Application EUI 
- Application Key, the AES encryption/decryption cipher application key
- Device address
- Network Session Key
- App Session Key    

for your node. 

Sparkfun has a nice [tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lorawan-with-prorf-and-the-things-network) how to get these requirements from [TheThingsInternet](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)

In addition you must define several LoRaWan parameters.
- Enable or disable adaptive data rate
- Set the default or a specific data rate
- Define if you want to connect to a public or private network
- Specify the number of join trials in case you use OTAA
- Specify the TX power
- Enable or disable the duty cycle transmissions. For EU retion the ETSI mandates duty cycled transmissions.

You can find a lot of information about LoRaWan on the [LoRa Alliance](https://lora-alliance.org/) website.

----
#### ArduinoIDE LoRaWan region definitions 
If you are using ArduinoIDE you need to edit the file ```/src/mac/Commissioning.h``` and define the region there.    
 
In Arduino IDE you can find the file in _**`<arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/SX126x-Arduino/src/mac`**_    
In PlatformIO this is usually _**`<user>/.platformio/lib/SX126x-Arduino/src/mac`**_    

The region is set right on the top of the file. Look for    
```
#if !defined(REGION_AS923) && !defined(REGION_AU915) && !defined(REGION_CN470) && !defined(REGION_CN779) && !defined(REGION_EU433) && !defined(REGION_EU868) && !defined(REGION_IN865) && !defined(REGION_KR920) && !defined(REGION_US915) && !defined(REGION_US915_HYBRID)
#define REGION_US915
#endif
```
and change the line
```
#define REGION_US915
```
to the region you want to use, e.g.    
```
#define REGION_EU868
```
**_RAKwireless RAK4630/RAK4631_**    
If you installed the BSP for these modules you can set the region from the Tools -> Board menu. You do not need to change ```/src/mac/Commissioning.h```    

----
#### PlatformIO LoRaWan region definitions 
If you are using PlatformIO you must define the region in the platformio.ini file of your project.     
Open the platformio.ini file and add a define for the region e.g.    
```
build_flags = -DREGION_AS923
```
Here a example for a complete platformio.ini file
```
[env:esp32dev]
platform = https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32.git#feature/stage
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
upload_port = COM6
upload_speed = 921600
build_flags = 
	-DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=ARDUHAL_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR
	-DREGION_EU868
```

### LoRaWan functions

#### Set EUIs and keys
To be able to send data over a gateway to an IoT application like TheThingsNetwork you need to set the EUIs and Keys for the device, the application and the sessions.
If you are using ABP activation all 6 values need to be set. If you are using OTAA activation, only the device EUI, the application EUI and the application key are required.    
For the difference between ABP and OTAA activation read the [TheThingsNetwork Wiki](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/address-space.html).    
The EUIs, keys and address should be defined in your code like this:    
```cpp
// Device EUI
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x00, 0x95, 0x64, 0x1F, 0xDA, 0x91, 0x19, 0x0B};
// Application EUI
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0x70, 0xB3, 0xD5, 0x7E, 0xD0, 0x02, 0x01, 0xE1};
// Application key for AES encryption
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x07, 0xC0, 0x82, 0x0C, 0x30, 0xB9, 0x08, 0x70, 0x0C, 0x0F, 0x70, 0x06, 0x00, 0xB0, 0xBE, 0x09};
// Device address
uint32_t nodeDevAddr = 0x260116F8;
// Network session key for AES encryption
uint8_t nodeNwsKey[16] = {0x7E, 0xAC, 0xE2, 0x55, 0xB8, 0xA5, 0xE2, 0x69, 0x91, 0x51, 0x96, 0x06, 0x47, 0x56, 0x9D, 0x23};
// Application session key for AES encryption
uint8_t nodeAppsKey[16] = {0xFB, 0xAC, 0xB6, 0x47, 0xF3, 0x58, 0x45, 0xC7, 0x50, 0x7D, 0xBF, 0x16, 0x8B, 0xA8, 0xC1, 0x7C};
```
Then, just before initializing the library set these values with
```cpp
// Setup the EUIs and Keys
lmh_setDevEui(nodeDeviceEUI);
lmh_setAppEui(nodeAppEUI);
lmh_setAppKey(nodeAppKey);
lmh_setNwkSKey(nodeNwsKey);
lmh_setAppSKey(nodeAppsKey);
lmh_setDevAddr(nodeDevAddr);
```
----
#### Connection to a single channel gateway
If the node talks to a single channel gateway you can fix the frequency and data rate and avoid frequency hopping. See more info in [LoRaWan single channel gateway](#lorawan-single-channel-gateway)
```cpp
 lmh_setSingleChannelGateway(uint8_t userSingleChannel, int8_t userDatarate)
```   
----
#### Initialize
Initialize LoRaWan. Select the join type OTAA by setting otaa to true. Select join type ABP by setting otaa to false.     
```cpp
 lmh_init(lmh_callback_t *callbacks, lmh_param_t lora_param, bool otaa)
```   
----
#### Specifiy sub bands
For some regions and some gateways you need to specifiy a sub band to be used.  See more info in [Limit frequency hopping to a sub band](#limit-frequency-hopping-to-a-sub-band)
```cpp
 lmh_setSubBandChannels(uint8_t subBand)
```   
**_RAKwireless RAK4630/RAK4631_**    
The subbands for each region are automatically preset to match with the RAKwireless gateways default settings. In this case you do not need to define the sub bands.        

----
#### Callbacks
LoRaWan needs callbacks and parameters defined before initialization    
```cpp
/** Lora user application data buffer. */ 
static uint8_t m_lora_app_data_buffer[LORAWAN_APP_DATA_BUFF_SIZE];
/** Lora user application data structure. */
static lmh_app_data_t m_lora_app_data = {m_lora_app_data_buffer, 0, 0, 0, 0};

/**@brief Structure containing LoRaWan parameters, needed for lmh_init()
 * 
 * Set structure members to
 * LORAWAN_ADR_ON or LORAWAN_ADR_OFF to enable or disable adaptive data rate
 * LORAWAN_DEFAULT_DATARATE OR DR_0 ... DR_5 for default data rate or specific data rate selection
 * LORAWAN_PUBLIC_NETWORK or LORAWAN_PRIVATE_NETWORK to select the use of a public or private network
 * JOINREQ_NBTRIALS or a specific number to set the number of trials to join the network
 * LORAWAN_DEFAULT_TX_POWER or a specific number to set the TX power used
 * LORAWAN_DUTYCYCLE_ON or LORAWAN_DUTYCYCLE_OFF to enable or disable duty cycles
 *                   Please note that ETSI mandates duty cycled transmissions. 
 */
static lmh_param_t lora_param_init = {LORAWAN_ADR_ON, 
			LORAWAN_DEFAULT_DATARATE, LORAWAN_PUBLIC_NETWORK, 
			JOINREQ_NBTRIALS, LORAWAN_DEFAULT_TX_POWER};

/**@brief Structure containing LoRaWan callback functions, needed for lmh_init() */

static lmh_callback_t lora_callbacks = {BoardGetBatteryLevel, BoardGetUniqueId, BoardGetRandomSeed,
	lorawan_rx_handler, lorawan_has_joined_handler, lorawan_confirm_class_handler, lpwan_joined_failed};
```    
The last callback function was added in library version 1.3.1. Before the app had to poll the status to see if OTAA join request had failed. The new callback is an addition to the `lorawan_has_joined_handler` callback. If the OTAA join request was successful, `lorawan_has_joined_handler` is called. If the OTAA join request fails (wrong EUI's, wrong Keys, or other reason), `lpwan_joined_failed` is called and the app can retry to join or notify an error.

----
#### Join
Join the LoRaWan network to be able to send and receive data. Default connection type is     
```cpp
void lmh_join(void)
```    
----
#### LoRaWan single channel gateway
By default when using LoRaWan communication, the node is using frequency hoping. That means that for each package to be sent a random frequency is chosen out of the predefined frequencies for a region. The frequency (== channels) for each region can be found in the file [CHANNELS.MD](./CHANNELS.MD).    
If connecting the node to a single channel gateway this is a problem, because a single channel gateway can receive only on one channel (== frequency). To get around this problem the channel hoping can be disabled and a fixed frequency (channel) and datarate can be set by the function
```cpp
void lmh_setSingleChannelGateway(uint8_t userSingleChannel, int8_t userDatarate);
```
The first paramenter is the channel (frequency) to be used to communicate with the single channel gateway.    
Check the specification of your single channel gateway to find out on which channel (frequency) it is listening and then get the channel number from the file [CHANNELS.MD](./CHANNELS.MD).     
The second parameter selects the datarate for the communication. Again check the specification of your single channel gateway to find out what datarate it is using and use it in the function call. It might be that instead of the datarate the spreading factor SF and bandwidth BW are documented. In this case you need to check the file [DATARATE.MD](./DATARATE.MD) to find out which datarate to choose.    
E.g. the [things4u ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0](https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0/tree/master/ESP-sc-gway) single channel gateway when setup to US915 region is listening on 902.30 Mhz with a bandwidth of 125kHz and a spreading factor of 7.
In **_CHANNEL.MD_** you can find that 902.30 MHz is channel 0 and in **_DATARATE.MD_** you can find that SF7 and BW 125 kHz would be for region US915 the data rate DR_3.
In this example we fix the communication to the channel 0 with the datarate DR_3 (SF7 and BW125);
```cpp
// Setup connection to a single channel gateway
lmh_setSingleChannelGateway(0, DR_3);
```
----
#### Limit frequency hopping to a sub band    
While testing the LoRaWan functionality I discovered that for some regions and some LoRaWan gateways it is required to limit the frequency hopping to a specific sub band of the region.    
E.g. in the settings of the LoRaWan gateway I bought for testing ([Dragino LPS8](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-gateway/item/148-lps8.html)) you have not only to define the region, but as well one of 8 sub bands. The gateway will listen only on the selected sub band.    
The problem is that if the LoRa node uses all available frequencies for frequency hopping, then for sure some of the packets will be lost, because they are sent on frequencies outside of the sub band on which the gateway is listening.    
Depending on the region, there could be between 2 and 12 sub bands to select from. Each sub band consists of 8 frequencies with a fixed distance between each. The sub bands are selected by numbers starting with **`1`** for the first sub band of 8 frequencies.   
_**You have to check with your LoRaWan gateway if you need to setup a sub band**_    
Example to limit the frequency hopping to sub band #1
```cpp
// For some regions we might need to define the sub band the gateway is listening to
/// \todo This is for Dragino LPS8 gateway. How about other gateways???
if (!lmh_setSubBandChannels(1))
{
	Serial.println("lmh_setSubBandChannels failed. Wrong sub band requested?");
}
```
